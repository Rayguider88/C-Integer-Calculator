# C-Integer-Calculator
A rudimentary calculator created with C++, specifically for using Integer variables. 


#include <iostream>
Using namspace std;
Int main ()

{

int firstNumber;
int secondNumber;

Cout << "Give me a number: " << endl; 

Cin >> firstNumber;

Cout << "Give me a second Number: " << endl;

Cin >> secondNumber;

Cout << " The Sum of the two numbers is: " << firstNumber + secondNumber << endl;

Cout << " The Difference of the two numbers is: " << firstNumber - secondNumber << endl;

Cout << " The Product of the two numbers is: " << firstNumber * secondNumber << endl;

Cout << " The Quotient of the two numbers is: " << firstNumber / secondNumber << endl;

Cout << " With a Remainder of: << firstNumber % secondNumber << endl;


return 0;
